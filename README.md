## Kuzushiji Character Recognition

A project to classify Kuzushiji characters similar to MNIST style classifying.

The dataset, Kuzushiji-49, is a byproduct of [Deep Learning for Classical Japanese Literature](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.01718.pdf), a paper intended to "engage the machine learning community into the world of classical Japanese literature."
